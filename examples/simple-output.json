Our office manager and CTO spearheaded months of site visits and negotiations, sharing everything from proposed locations to paint colors with the team. After months of searching, we found a space in a vibrant neighborhood in the heart of Paris, just next to the lovely River Seine. At roughly 8600 square feet, the location would allow us to host meetings and workshops as well as accommodate our fast growing team. In fact, once we found out about the wide choice of restaurants to try out during lunch, there was no other address for us but 88 Rue de Rivoli."
